    <p> I finally got past my resizable window dilemma after a while.</p>
    <img src = "Screenshot 2024-02-09 at 07-05-31 Windows XP UI.png">
    <p> This is an attempt of explaining how this was done</p>
    <li>
        <ul> 
            Bunch of divs are created to take place as the <strong> borders </strong> of the resizable window and receive the mouse events
        </ul>
        <ul> 
            When any of them are pressed, the function <strong> resizeWindow() </strong> is called
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li> Bunch of variables are created to store useful informations about the Window and the events </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li> A variable called 'tackledBorder' gets the ID of the border clicked and activates the resizing Event</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li> As the mouse moves, the event happens and calculation based on the offset distance (top and left) and the height/width happens!</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Each corner and side has their own different calculation</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <p> I also implemented a behavior to show the window open over the footer bar.</p>
