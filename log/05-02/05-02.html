   <h2>RETRO UI</h2>
   <h3> FEB 5</h3>
   <p> The Retro UI project is definitely challenging and complicated but i'm enjoying it so far. Today i made the progress i was intending since yesterday, which was make all windows movable with mouse movement. It behaves a little like this: </p> 
   <ol>
        <li> I press over the window header. It gets me the MOUSE position in that moment. </li>
        <li> When the mouse moves, there's a calculation of the mouse trajectory from the first clicking to the END</li>
        <li> This is what it's used to distantiate the window from it's corners </li>
        <li> When the mouse is pressed up or leaves the window, the events stop</li>
   </ol>

   <p> Now what i want to do is to make all the Windows a object inside Windows Manager. I need to see how i did it in the old code and apply it in the same way. It just now came to me that i might not be allowed to be doing this bc of copyright, but i want to reinforce this has purely <strong> learning purposes</strong>, not a financial one. So please don't sue me i guess </p>

   <p> I'm letting go of the idea of making every Window a object bc the code is getting confusing and convoluted, and the only way i got it working was without it</p>
